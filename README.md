# ΔIf — A Digital Archive of Counterfactuals (v2.0)

ΔIf is an experimental web platform exploring the tension between Absence (The Void) and Excess (The Noise).

## Core Mechanics
1. **Duality Engine:** Strict DOM swapping between narrative states.
2. **Entropy Engine:** JS Physics loop manipulating text element coordinates.
3. **Sensory Field:** Web Audio API tracking cursor position for stereo panning.

## Setup
1. Clone repository.
2. Add `ambient.mp3` to `assets/` folder.
3. Open `index.html` in a live server (VS Code Live Server extension recommended to avoid CORS issues with Audio API).
